We're building a platform agnpostic game as both a test for ourselves and a product for personal enjoyment and the enrichment of those that will be able to play it. We're currently calling it Retribution Online but it's based on a fictional world we crafted for a previous game project that went by the name Retribution, and primarily involves tactical turn based combat on a hexagonal game grid between various humanoid species, such as humans, goblins, and dwarves.

We're building a browser-based javascript game as both a test for ourselves and a product for the enrichment of those that will be able to play it for free on the internet with their mothers permission to use her internet. We're currently calling it Retribution Online. It's based on a fictional subterranean world filled with various humanoid species such as humans, goblins, and dwarves. The gameplay primarily involves tactical turn-based exploration, combat, and death. The interface is an isometric perspective of a hex-based game grid with low resolution sprites.
